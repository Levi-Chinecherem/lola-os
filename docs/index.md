# LOLA OS Documentation

Welcome to **LOLA OS**: Layered Orchestration for Logic and Automation, an open-source Python framework for EVM-native AI agents.

## Overview

LOLA OS is designed to empower developers to build autonomous agents that interact with Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) blockchains, leveraging AI for logic and automation. Key features include:

- **EVM-Native**: Read on-chain data using `web3.py`.
- **Agent Templates**: ReAct, Plan-Execute, and more.
- **RAG Integration**: Enhanced queries with Pinecone and LlamaIndex.
- **CLI Tools**: Scaffold, run, build, and deploy agents.
