# LOLA OS Documentation

Welcome to the official documentation for **LOLA OS** (Layered Orchestration for Logic and Automation), an open-source Python framework for building Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-native AI agents. This documentation covers the TMVP 1 release (v1.0.0), providing a mocked prototype with core abstractions, agent templates, tools, CLI, examples, and more.

## Overview

LOLA OS enables developers to create AI agents with EVM-native capabilities, adhering to principles of Developer Sovereignty, EVM-Native, Radical Reliability, Choice by Design, and Explicit over Implicit. Key features include:

- **Core Abstractions**: Modular agent, graph, state, and memory management.
- **Agent Templates**: ReAct, PlanExecute, and Collaborative agents.
- **Tools**: Web search, EVM contract calls, human-in-the-loop, and more.
- **Examples**: [Research Agent](examples/research_agent/README.md) and [Onchain Analyst](examples/onchain_analyst/README.md).
