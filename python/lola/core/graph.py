"""
File: Defines the StateGraph, Node, and Edge classes for LOLA OS TMVP 1.

Purpose: Provides the orchestration engine for agent workflows.
How: Implements a directed acyclic graph (DAG) with nodes (tasks) and edges (transitions).
Why: Enables explicit, traceable workflows, per Radical Reliability and Explicit over Implicit.
Full Path: lola-os/python/lola/core/graph.py
Future Optimization: Migrate to Rust for parallel node execution via Tokio (post-TMVP 1).
