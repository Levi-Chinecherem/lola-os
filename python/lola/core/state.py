File: Defines the State Pydantic model for LOLA OS graph execution.

Purpose: Provides a strongly-typed, serializable state for tracking agent execution context.
How: Uses Pydantic for validation and serialization, stores data like query, history, and outputs.
Why: Ensures radical reliability via explicit state management, per LOLA's tenets.
