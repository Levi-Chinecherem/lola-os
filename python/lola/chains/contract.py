File: Defines the Contract class for LOLA OS TMVP 1 Phase 2.

Purpose: Provides an interface for interacting with EVM contracts.
How: Wraps web3.py contract calls.
Why: Simplifies contract operations for tools, per EVM-Native tenet.
Full Path: lola-os/python/lola/chains/contract.py
Future Optimization: Migrate to Rust for efficient calls (post-TMVP 1).
