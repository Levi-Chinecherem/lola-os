File: Defines the ChainConnection class for LOLA OS TMVP 1 Phase 2.

Purpose: Provides a connection to EVM chains for read operations.
How: Uses web3.py to connect to RPC providers.
Why: Enables real EVM access for agents, per EVM-Native tenet.
Full Path: lola-os/python/lola/chains/connection.py
Future Optimization: Migrate to Rust for fast connections (post-TMVP 1).
